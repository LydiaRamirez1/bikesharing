## Summary
The data shows increased activity for the bike sharing service in New York during the month of August in 2019.
The far majority of the rides were in the very busy Manhattan Island, taken by male users during morning and evening rush hours. This implies that Citi Bike services are used as an alternative to public transportation by commuting workers. A few recommended visualizations for future analyses would be the most popular areas of Des Moines in order to determine the best place to put more bikes, as well as the amount of commuting males vs commuting females as the males seem to use the bike sharing service more.
